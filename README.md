## Disclaimer

This repository serves as a chronological archive of my learning journey in software development and programming. Please keep the following in mind when browsing the examples:

- Many folders and code samples reflect the stage at which I was learning a particular concept.
- **Dynamic Programming**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Text Generation** folders or files contain earlier examples and may not represent best practices or optimized solutions.
- The **PAModel** and **flask_game** folders contain only the scripts that I personally wrote as part of larger projects. They are **not standalone or functional applications**, but rather fragments meant to be integrated within broader systems.

The purpose of this repository is educational and historical, not all code is production-ready or complete.


## Repository Structure 

- **`Dynamic Programming/`**  
  _Early experiments with dynamic programming concepts._

- **`OOP/`**  
  _Introductory object-oriented programming code samples._

- **`Text Generation_API Integration.py`**  
  _Initial work on basic NLP and text generation with API integration._

- **`PAModel_Training.ipynb`**  
  _Project-specific model training script â€” not a standalone application._

- **`flask_game.py`**  
  _Script contribution to a larger Flask-based game project._

- **`README.md`**  
  _This file._


Feel free to explore, but interpret each folder in the context of its time and purpose.
