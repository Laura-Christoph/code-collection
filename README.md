## Disclaimer

This repository serves as a chronological archive of my learning journey in software development and programming. Please keep the following in mind when browsing the examples:

- Many folders and code samples reflect the stage at which I was learning a particular concept.
- **Dynamic Programming**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Text Generation** folders or files contain earlier examples and may not represent best practices or optimized solutions.
- The **PAModel** and **flask_game** folders contain only the scripts that I personally wrote as part of larger projects. They are **not standalone or functional applications**, but rather fragments meant to be integrated within broader systems.

The purpose of this repository is educational and historical, not all code is production-ready or complete.


## Repository Structure 

├── Dynamic Programming/     # Early experiments with DP
├── OOP/            # Introductory OOP code samples
├── Text Generation_API Integration.py         # Initial work on basic NLP and generation
├── PAModel_Training.ipynb                 # Project-specific model component (not standalone)
├── flask_game.py              # Script contributions to a Flask-based game project

Feel free to explore, but interpret each folder in the context of its time and purpose.
